# Land Token Contracts

## Overview

The Land Token Contracts provide a framework for representing and managing virtual land assets on the blockchain. These contracts facilitate the minting, transferring, and management of land tokens, which can represent parcels of land in a virtual world or game.

By leveraging ERC standards and best practices, the Land Token Contracts ensure compatibility and interoperability with wallets, marketplaces, and other decentralized applications.

## Features

- **ERC-721 Compliance**: Implements the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard for unique land tokens.
- **Minting and Burning**: Allows authorized users to mint new land tokens and burn existing ones.
- **Metadata Support**: Integrates metadata for each land token, including coordinates, attributes, and other details.
- **Access Control**: Utilizes role-based permissions for secure management.
- **Batch Operations**: Supports batch transfers and approvals for efficient management.
